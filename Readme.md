# Getting-and-Cleaning-data-course-project_Week-4
This repository was created regarding the week 4 assignment of Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course by Johns Hopkins University.

The first step is to download and unzip the data file provided.

Load it into your R working directory

The second step is to download the R source code into the working directory.

Finally, we execute the R source code to generate the tidy data set.

# About the data:
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

# Generated dataset:
The new dataset that is generated contained variables which are calculated based on their mean and standard deviation. Each row of the dataset is an average of each activity type for all subjects.

# Code:
The code shows the combination of the provided training and testing data. These are combined and then the variables are extracted to generate the new dataset with the averages for the activities.

# Instructions given are:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The code follows the given instructions.
